AI Candidate Test Tasks – Module 2 (Single Wall Fitting)
This document outlines two technical tasks designed to evaluate an AI candidate&#39;s skills
relevant to Module 2 (Single Wall Fitting with TVs, frames, and paintings). The tasks focus
on wall segmentation, product placement, and enhancement of Stable Diffusion models for
realistic AR try-on experiences.
Task 1 – Wall Segmentation &amp; Product Placement (AI Fallback)
Objective: Test ability to segment walls from an image and realistically place an object
(TV/painting).
Description:
- Input: A room photo (with visible wall).
- Output:
1. Detect and mask the wall region using an AI vision model (SAM / U-Net / custom
segmentation).
2. Place a given TV/painting frame image (PNG with transparency) onto the wall with
correct scaling &amp; alignment.
3. Ensure the final result blends well (no overlap on furniture, lighting adjusted if possible).
Evaluation Criteria:
- Accuracy of wall segmentation.
- Proper scaling &amp; perspective of TV/painting on wall.
- Visual realism (natural placement, not copy-pasted).
- Code quality (clean Python or PyTorch/TensorFlow pipeline).
Task 2 – Stable Diffusion Fine-Tuning for Product Placement
Objective: Test candidate’s ability to adapt Stability models (ControlNet/DreamBooth) for
AR use cases.
Description:
- Given:
- A set of product images (e.g., 2–3 TV/painting variants).
- A room photo (wall image).
- Use Stable Diffusion + ControlNet (depth or inpaint) to:
1. Generate an image where the chosen product is realistically placed on the wall.
2. Show at least two product size variations (e.g., 42” vs 55” TV).

Evaluation Criteria:
- Ability to set up Stable Diffusion pipeline (Hugging Face / Diffusers / Automatic1111).
- Correct ControlNet conditioning (depth/inpainting).
- Output quality (alignment, scaling, shadows).
- Understanding of fine-tuning/custom training (even at prototype level).
